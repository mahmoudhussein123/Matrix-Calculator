## 💡 About the Project

This Matrix Calculator was developed using C++ with a focus on both accuracy and efficiency.  
Here’s what was implemented:

- ✅ Designed and built a robust matrix calculator supporting:
  - Addition, Subtraction  
  - Multiplication & Scalar Division  
  - Transpose (Aᵀ) and Determinant calculation  
- ✅ Debugged and optimized the code for better performance and reliability.  
- ✅ Applied core mathematical and linear algebra concepts while improving C++ programming practices.  
- ✅ Structured the project for scalability and clean code to make future features (like inverse, file I/O, GUI) easier to add.

## 🚀 Features

| Operation      | Description                                      |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Addition (+)   | Adds two matrices of the same dimensions.        |
| Subtraction (-)| Subtracts one matrix from another.               |
| Multiplication (A × B) | Supports matrix × matrix or matrix × scalar. |
| Division (/ )  | Divides matrix by a scalar value.                |
| Transpose (Aᵀ) | Flips matrix over its main diagonal.             |
